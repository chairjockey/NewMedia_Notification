# NewMedia_Notification

Script used in my User-Scripts on Unraid system to send me an email every morning (cron job) of any new downloaded Movies and/or TV Shows.

Scans folders for new files w/in last 24hrs (atime 1) and emails me that list using Unraid's notification system (must be setup in unraid first before it will work).

Also will generate a list of all movies (as a catalog) and a smaller file of movie file types and total number of movies.
